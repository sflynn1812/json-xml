UNIX

 1. Install a yajl (with headers, e.g. libyajl-dev)
 2. Run make

      make
 
 3. If the yajl installation can't be found by the compiler, try adjusting
    the Makefile:
      
      CFLAGS  += -I/path/to/yajl/headers
      LDFLAGS += -L/path/to/yajl/ibs

 4. Optionally, install:
 
      make install

WINDOWS

(For MinGW from an MSYS shell, follow the Unix steps above.)

A Windows version of yajl is provided. By default, the Windows version of
json-yaml statically links it so no DLL is required to run the program.

 1. Install Visual C++
 2. Open a developer command prompt with access to cl.exe and nmake.exe
 3. Run nmake

      namke /f Makefile.vc
